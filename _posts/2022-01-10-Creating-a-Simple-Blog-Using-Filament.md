title: "Creating a Simple Blog Using Filament"
---

In this tutorial, we will discuss the steps to create a simple blog using Filament, a powerful and intuitive administrative panel builder for Laravel applications. This blog will have basic features such as displaying a list of posts, showing single posts, and a form to add new posts.

### Step 1: Project Preparation

1. **Install Filament**: Make sure you have installed Filament CLI by running the `npm install -g filament-cli` command.

2. **Create a New Project**: Create a new project by running the command `filament create project-name`. Follow the prompts to complete the project creation process.

3. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Navigate to the newly created project directory by running `cd project-name`.

### Step 2: Designing the Blog Layout

1. **Component Structure**: Create a component structure for your blog. For example, components for the post list (`PostList`), single post (`SinglePost`), and adding a new post form (`AddPostForm`).

2. **Design Layout**: Design the layout for each component using HTML and CSS. Make sure to add necessary interactions, such as buttons to open the add post form.

### Step 3: Implementing Business Logic

1. **Dummy Data**: Create dummy data for blog posts using JavaScript objects. For example:

    ```javascript
    const posts = [
      { id: 1, title: 'Post Title 1', content: 'Post Content 1' },
      { id: 2, title: 'Post Title 2', content: 'Post Content 2' },
      // add more posts as needed
    ];
    ```

2. **Displaying Post List**: Implement logic to display the list of posts in the `PostList` component using the `map` method on the `posts` array.

3. **Displaying Single Post**: Implement logic to display a single post in the `SinglePost` component. Retrieve post data based on the ID received as a prop.

4. **Adding a New Post**: Implement logic to add a new post in the `AddPostForm` component. Create a form with inputs for title and post content, along with a button to add the post.

### Step 4: Routing

1. **Route Configuration**: Configure routes for your application to handle navigation between the post list page, single post page, and add post form.

2. **Navigation**: Add navigation between pages using links (`<a>` tags or the `Link` component from Filament).

### Step 5: Testing and Maintenance

1. **Testing**: Test your application to ensure that all features work as expected. Check the appearance and functionality on various devices and browsers.

2. **Code Maintenance**: Make sure to perform regular maintenance on your code. Fix any bugs found and make feature enhancements as needed.


By following the above steps, you have now successfully created a simple blog using Filament. You can continue to develop this application by adding additional features as needed. Happy coding!
